We used this data for our grid map to find where immigrants to Alaska are settling and in what bouroughs and census areas.

We used this census data for the boundaries of the Alaska bouroughs and census areas.

We used this story for our narrative cartography and scraped the geographic data using an API to upload to Mapbox.


## Gallery of images with key points and captions:

In this image, we can see where all the migrants to Alaska are coming from and which places in Alaska they are all going to. The points in purple are representing the locations of where the migrants originated and the green dots are representing where they eventually ended up. We thought this was significant because it shows that people come to Alaska from so many different countries across the world and its important to understand that when we're thinking about the immigrant's journey. Each of them likely had their own story like Abdirahman Shire's and we wanted to make it so the sheer number of points would impress you for where people came from. In our data, we even have the number amount for how many people came from each country and region and where they settled within Alaska based on those green points.

In this image, we can see the full journey of Abdirahman Shire from Somalia to Alaska. Each point represents a specific place he stopped in to either work or live. We thought this was significant because it shows how far some immigrants travel and how much hardship they have to go through until they find a place to settle down and work on building their own lives. This was a long journey for him and we think it's very eye-opening to represent that spatially.
